## Titanic-Machine-Learning & Boston-Housing
Titanic is one of classical Kaggle Competition and my machine learning initial point as well.
# INTRODUCTION
[The Titanic_level 1](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level1.py) didn't use any module to predict the result but hand crafting by myself from zero.\
[The Titanic_level 2](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/titanic_level2.py) utilized sklearn to build the model.\
[Boston-Housing](https://github.com/johnny880624/Titanic-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Titanic%26BostonHousing/boston_housing_competition.py) is kinda extension of Titanic, using module to build the model.
