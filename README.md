## Titanic-Machine-Learning & Boston-Housing
Titanic is one of classical Kaggle Competition and my machine learning initial point as well.
# INTRODUCTION
[The Titanic_level 1]() didn't use any module to predict the result but hand crafting by myself from zero.
[The Titanic_level 2]() utilized sklearn to build the model.
[Boston-Housing]() is kinda extension of Titanic, using module to build the model.
